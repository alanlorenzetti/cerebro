# Cerebro: Spontaneous Mutant Finder

This software was conceived to find spontaneous mutants of _Halobacterium salinarum_ NRC-1 when grown on solid media, and compute their frequency of appearance. For that, it will used pre-processed photographies of plated colonies.  

## Usage

## Requirements

* Cropped Plates
* A few R packages: EBImage (BioConductor), dplyr (CRAN) and ggplot2 (CRAN). 

You have to install the R packages before running the script. Some of them might rely on external libraries. It's the case of Fast Fourier Transforms required by EBImage (it installs fftwtools which relies on libfftw3-dev on Ubuntu), so you gotta make everything work first.  

## Software Name

Yes, Charles Xavier's machine indeed.
